docker-compose up -d -> to test everything works

Completed
X - Set up branches (main, develop, feature, release, hotfix)
X - Minikube: Ensure it's running for Kubernetes deployments

To Do
Implement SonarQube and other elements into the Jenkinsfile
Maybe run this locally in the Jenkins

Terraform: Run terraform init in the terraform directory
Push code to develop branch → Should trigger dev deployment
Create release/v1.0 branch → Should trigger staging deployment
Merge to main → Should trigger prod deployment (with manual approval)


Testing
Testing Integration:

Database First: Start with your database service
Product Service: Ensure it can connect to database
Order Service: Ensure it can connect to database and product service
Frontend: Should connect to both API services

Key Ports:

Frontend: 3000 (development), 80 (production)
Product Service: 3001
Order Service: 3002
Database: 5432

Contingencies:

Database Connection Issues:

Check if PostgreSQL container is running
Verify environment variables match
Use docker logs container-name to debug


Cross-service Communication:

Ensure services are on same Docker network
Use service names (not localhost) in docker-compose


Build Failures:

Check Node.js version compatibility
Clear npm cache: npm cache clean --force
Remove node_modules and reinstall


Frontend API Calls Failing:

Verify CORS is enabled on backend services
Check API URLs in environment variables
Test backend endpoints directly with curl/Postman

Quick Validation:
bash# Test each service health endpoint
curl http://localhost:3001/health  # Product service
curl http://localhost:3002/health  # Order service
curl http://localhost:3000         # Frontend
